ðŸ”© Hardware Requirements for Project FROST


1. Core Controller
ESP32 Development Board (with built-in Wi-Fi + Bluetooth)

2. Sensors & Inputs
IR Sensor (for motion/proximity detection or user interaction)

3. Display
OLED Display (e.g., 0.96" or 1.3", I2C, SSD1306 driver) and 
16x2 LCD with I2C backpack (for easier wiring, only SDA/SCL pins needed)

4. Audio Output
Internal DAC of ESP32 (GPIO25 / GPIO26)
(Optional: Audio amplifier module (e.g., PAM8403) for louder output)
External Bluetooth Speaker (paired with ESP32 via Bluetooth)
(ESP32 streams audio wirelessly instead of using DAC directly)

5. Power Supply
Micro-USB cable (for programming + powering ESP32)

6. Other Components
Breadboard (for prototyping)
Jumper wires (male-male, male-female)
